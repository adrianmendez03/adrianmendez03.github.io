## Project Description
This page will be a showcase of projects I've created but the website itself should be representative of my abilities as a developer. I've chosen to build this with vanilla CSS, Javascript and jQuery. I chose not to use any css libraries because I wanted 100% control of my styling. All these techs with mixed with lots of work and headache will result in a site that is modern, sharp, and intuitive.

## Issues and Resolutions
- Making my landing page container sit under the nav bar. The solution was to set the position to relative and subtract the top by the size of the navbar
- After I added background color to my landing page, it covered my navbar. My initial thought was to add a higher z index to the nav, sp I played with the z index to no avail. I searched why it wasn't having an effect on my navbar and turns out I had to give it a display other than static for it to work. I didn't have the display to static but who knows!
